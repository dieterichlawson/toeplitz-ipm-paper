\section{Introduction}
Consider the cone of positive-semidefinite Toeplitz matrices
\[
  \toepcn_n = \{x \in \reals^n \mid \toep(x) \geq 0\}
\]
with $\toep(x)$ defined as

\[
  \toep(x)_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      x_{|i-j|+1} &  0 \leq |i-j| \leq n-1 \\
      0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}.
\]

In words, $\toep (x)$ is the square Toeplitz matrix resulting from taking the $i$th
entry of $x$ as the $i$th sub- and super-diagonal. This cone appears in various applications
in signal processing \todo[inline]{Flesh out applications}. In this paper we investigate methods for cone programming
over $\toepcn$, i.e. we present methods for solving problems of the form

\begin{equation}\label{primal}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{minimize}    & c^Tx \\
    \mbox{subject to } & Ax = b \\
                       & x \in \toepcn_n. 
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

where $x\in \reals^n$ is the optimization variable, $c \in \reals^n$, $A \in \reals^{m\times n}$, 
and $b \in \reals^m$. The central difficulty for problems of this form is that $\toepcn_n$
is not symmetric, so much of the standard primal-dual machinery becomes unweildly.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first explore the properties of 
$\toepcn_n$, deriving its dual and showing that it is not symmetric. To motivate
new algorithms we then investigate how un-symmetric cones present a problem for a standard 
primal-dual interior point method. We discuss a suitable barrier for $\toepcn_n$ 
and its use in two different algorithms that make speed gains over the standard primal-dual
interior-point method by forgoing pieces of the dual picture. Finally we present some 
numeric results from these algorithms. Note that nothing presented here is original, and in
many cases follows our sources literally.

\section{The Positive Semi-Definite Toeplitz Cone}

To characterize the dual of $\toepcn_n$ we show that $\toepcn_n$ is the dual of the 
cone of finite autocorrelation sequences. A finite autocorrelation sequence is a vector
$x \in \reals^n$ with a $y \in \reals^n$ such that 
\[
  x_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n-k} y_iy_{i+k} \quad k=1,\ldots,n.
\] 
For any positive scalar $\alpha$, $\alpha x$ can be represented as above 
by $\alpha^{1/2}y$, so the set of finite autocorrelation sequences forms a cone.
The dual of $\corrcn_n$ is 
\[
  \corrcn^*_n = \{z \in \reals^n \mid z^Tx \geq 0 \text{ for } x \in \corrcn_n\}.
\]
If $z^Tx \geq 0$ for all $x \in \corrcn_n$, then for all
$y \in \reals^n$ 
\[
  z^Tx \geq 0 \iff \sum_{i=1}^n z_i \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n-k} y_iy_{i+k}\right).
\]
\todo[inline]{probably don't want that iff symbol in there}
The summation above can be expressed in terms of the Toeplitz form of $z$ ---
the above is true if and only if $y^TT_n(z)y \geq 0$ for all $y \in \reals^n$. Thus
$\corrcn^*_n$ is exactly the positive semi-definite Toeplitz cone, $\toepcn_n$. Nonempty,
closed, convex cones are reflexive, so $\toepcn_n^* = \corrcn_n$, and $\toepcn_n$ is not
symmetric.

\todo[inline]{Do we need more than this? Is it clear that these aren't the same thing or should we provide an example?}
\todo[inline]{Do we need to show that it is nonempty, closed, and convex? Or is that too obvious?}

Let $\psi_n(x)$ be a self-concordant $\nu$ logarithmically homogenous barrier for $\toepcn_n$.
Recall that $\nu$ logarithmically homogenous functions satisfy
\[
  \psi_n(tx) = -\nu \log(t) + \psi_n(x).
\]
Similarly, let $\psi^*_n(z)$ be the conjugate barrier to $\psi_n$
\[
  \psi^*_n(x) = \max\{-s^Tx- \psi_n(x) \mid x \in \toepcn_n\}.
\]
In TODO:ref(Nesterov 94 or 96) it is shown that $\psi^*_n$ is a self-concordant and $\nu$ logarithmically homogenous barrier function for
$\corrcn_n$. 

\section{A Standard Primal-Dual Interior-Point Method}
We turn now to consider primal-dual interior point methods and their unsuitability for
solving un-symmetric cone problems. The dual problem of (\ref{primal}) is 
\begin{equation}\label{dual}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \mbox{maximize}    & b^Ty \\
    \mbox{subject to } & c= A^Ty + s\\
                       & s \in \corrcn_n. 
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
where $y,s\in \reals^n$ are the optimization variables. Any solution of (\ref{primal}) and (\ref{dual})
must satisfy the optimality conditions
\begin{equation}\label{optcond}
  Ax = b\\
  A^Ty + s = c\\
\end{equation}
